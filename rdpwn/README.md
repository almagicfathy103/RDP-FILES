Work in progress. ONLY support python2.7 since rdpy only supports py27.  
This tool automatically connects to an RDP server and tries to get a command shell by trying sticky keys and then utilman and then smashes a command of your choice into the box and closes the session. The whole process takes about 4 seconds.  
I still have to enable credential list attempts and then Win-R -> cmd -> your command.  
I wanted to do the hard stuff first.  

Also the code is a mess. :)
